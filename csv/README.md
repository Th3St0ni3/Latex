# CSV folder (comma separate values)

This folder is for measurement readings and other kinds of data collection.  
It is named *CSV*, but you could also use different file types, even though the `.csv` type is the easiest to include in LaTeX.  
Keep in mind, that the config sets the `;` as the separator, which is the German standard

# Export Excel to CSV

Excel is a great tool for collecting and doing calculation on measured data, but is not so good for using that data in other tools. That's why there
is a VBA macro, that makes it super easy to export excel-sheets into separate CSV documents, which can be used in Latex and easily reexported on
changes in the Excel file.

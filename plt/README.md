# Plots-folder

This folder is for plots and graphs. It exists mostly because it is recommended to use the `pgf-plots` package. This huge and powerful package also
brings up the compiler time of a `.tex` file by a lot. That's why it is recommended to create separate files for every plot a just import the resulting
`.pdf` file into the final document, recompiling the graph itself only when needed.

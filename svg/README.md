# SVG-Folder

The svg format is widely used for web graphics and vector graphics. This makes it useful for creating complex graphics and illustrations.

# Image creation with Inkscape

Inkscape is an amazing vector graphics tool with an export to LaTeX feature. I highly recommend it for creating complex images like sketches of
experimental setup.
